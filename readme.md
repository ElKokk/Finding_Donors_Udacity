# Content: Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML 
(a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. 
Next, we will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
We will then evaluate several supervised learners of our choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
Afterwards, we will optimize the model we've selected and present it as a solution to CharityML. 
Finally, we will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Udacity - Starting the Project

For this assignment, you can find the `finding_donors` folder containing the necessary project files on the [Machine Learning projects GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), under the `projects` folder. You may download all of the files for projects we'll use in this Nanodegree program directly from this repo. Please make sure that you use the most recent version of project files when completing a project!

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `census.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes. Do not modify

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command `jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb` to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project. A **README** file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project. 

## Submitting the Project

### Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the **<a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/406/view" target="_blank">Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric</a>**. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.

### Submission Files
When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload. Alternatively, you may supply the following files on your GitHub Repo in a folder named `student_intervention` for ease of access:
 - The `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.
 - An **HTML** export of the project notebook with the name **report.html**. This file *must* be present for your project to be evaluated.

Once you have collected these files and reviewed the project rubric, proceed to the project submission page.

### I'm Ready!
When you're ready to submit your project, click on the **Submit Project** button at the bottom of the page.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at **machine-support@udacity.com** or visit us in the <a href="http://discussions.udacity.com" target="_blank">discussion forums</a>.

### What's Next?
You will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!
